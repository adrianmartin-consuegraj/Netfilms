# Netfilms App

This is the real Netflix project but I gave the idea to Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph because I had some others and to share is to live (:

## How does this work?

- The data of some movies and series was introduced into Workbench MySQL DataBase. Movies and series are stored in differents tables.
- All the data is recovered from the DB with Spring Boot and put into a local host with Json format. This part of the app is entirely coded with Java.
- The page is printed with React once all the Json data is fetched and placed in the proper component.
