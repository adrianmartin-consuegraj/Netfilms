# Netfilms API

## How does this work?

I've used an API called "The Movie Database" to get all the information about some films and series. 
After that I've stored all the data I wanted in the data base with MySQL Workbench, which provides me all the information I need to create this API with Spring.
Depending of the endpoint you set in the localhost, you will be able to get some films or series.
